# Education Performance Analysis

## Background
Educational outcomes are not determined by grades alone. Family background, motivation, and educational environment often play an important role in shaping students’ academic performance. This project was created to explore how certain educational factors relate to students’ final academic results using simple data analysis techniques.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains student-related information such as:
- Gender
- Parents' education level
- Study hours
- Final academic score

The data is used to observe patterns and relationships between family educational background and student performance.

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to analyze whether parents’ education levels and students’ academic intentions are associated with differences in final academic scores.

## Tools and Technologies
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## Analysis and Key Findings
From the analysis conducted, several patterns were observed:
- Students whose parents have higher education levels tend to achieve higher final academic scores.
- Academic performance appears to be influenced not only by study hours, but also by educational environment and background.
- The results suggest a correlation between family education level and student performance, rather than a direct cause-and-effect relationship.

## Conclusion
This project helped me understand how data can be used to explore educational issues and social factors. Through this analysis, I became more interested in applying data science to real-world problems, particularly in the field of education.

## Future Work
In future studies, this analysis could be expanded by:
- Using larger and more diverse datasets  
- Applying statistical tests to strengthen the analysis  
- Exploring machine learning models to predict academic performance
